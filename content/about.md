Hi! I'm a Senior Software/DevOps engineer who currently works at [Silktide](https://silktide.com).

I largely spend my time trying to make things scale, whether that's database optimisation, profiling or writing
applications to allow for better horizontal job running.

If you want to get in contact, you can do so [here](mailto:nelmon2k+dochne@gmail.com)
