Nothing all that important to talk about here at the moment, but I do have a couple of bits of sidework that I've found
interesting.

### Sudoku

Learning new programming languages is a pain. Going through different tutorials gives you an approximate jist of the
language, but doesn't give you any knowledge gained in anger.

Enter [Sudoku](https://github.com/dolondro/sudoku). Simply put it's just a repository containing me attempting to write
the most basic sudoku solver in every language I can be bothered with.

The benchmarks end up being a bit micro-benchmarky but also gives you [a reasonable idea](https://github.com/Dolondro/sudoku/blob/master/benchmark.md)
of how fast the languages are comparatively.
